Rod McChesney has been developing software professionally since
1982. He's worked in a variety of areas for companies including Tibco,
Sun Microsystems (including SunSoft and JavaSoft), NOCPulse, and
Openwave.  He's currently at at Postini (soon to be a Google
subsidiary) working as the technical lead for the web applications
group.<br/>
At NOCpulse he worked on a SaaS system monitoring product that was
developed with a home-rolled agile approach, delivering updates every
three to four weeks. Having seen how well this can work in practice,
he's tried to bring the ideas to teams at other companies, with
varying success. The Postini web applications team has been using its
own agile approach for about a year, and using XPlanner for about the
last six months.</p>
